A Javascript remake of https://rage.mp/files/file/461-c-player-location-display/

Hey!

This is my first resource that I am publically releasing.
For you all, I have ported the C# Player Location Display (https://rage.mp/files/file/461-c-player-location-display/) into JS.

## Screenshots

## Install

Put `/street` into your server's client_packages directory, then addÂ `require("./street/index.js");` to client_packages/index.js


I know the code isn't the best optimized, please feel free to open a pull request!
